                <p>
                    For my 
                    <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/csce/">CSCE315</a> 
                    course, I have created a personal website. The purpose of this assignment was to 
                    help establish a professional presence on the internet for potential employers. It 
                    contains information about me, my projects, and my qualifications. This website was 
                    made using mainly HTML and CSS with a little bit of JavaScript.

            <div class="project">

                <p>
                    This project is my first foray into game development with the engine 
                    <a href="https://www.unity.com/">Unity</a>. 
                    Through working on this game, I have been able to learn the fundamentals of Unity and even game
                    design altogether. This project is unfinished, but I plan to continue updating it in the 
                    future.

                <h2><img src="./assets/sword.png" alt="Sword Icon"> Roguelike Game</h2>

                <p>
                    I have not officially started working on this project yet. However, it is something that I
                    have wanted to work on for a while. The roguelike genre of video games is one of my favorites,
                    and I think it would be very interesting to develop one of my own. There is still much for me
                    to learn in the world of game design, and I look forward to working on this project. For this
                    project, I would like to experiment with the 
                    <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine</a>. 
                    I plan on updating it here as I go along.
