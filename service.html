                <h2>Paris Regional Medical Center</h2>

                <p>
                    In my hometown, the hospital runs a volunteer program for people to help provide
                    services to patients and hospital staff. This program allows people from the community
                    to help keep the hospital running smoothly, whether it be helping guide people around 
                    the facility or helping restock the storage room. While I went to high school, I would
                    volunteer in this program over the summer. In doing so, I was able to make a difference
                    in the community and learn more about it too. At the hospital, you are able to meet so
                    many people from your community and can learn a lot from the people who work with you.
                    Volunteering at the hospital was an experience that I will never forget, and I would
                    gladly do it again.

                <h2>Quest Academy</h2>

                <p>
                    Quest Academy is a schooling program in my hometown for kids of all ages. They have many
                    classes on their roster, ranging from chess to Spanish to even college exam preparation.
                    This can be a great resource for kids to get extra help when they need it. I have not worked
                    at Quest yet, but I am interested in helping out. As I have a lot of knowledge in many of 
                    the subject areas, I could help teach and supervise many classes. In addition, with the skills
                    that I have learned at Texas A&M, I could possibly help teach a computer science course to get
                    kids started early. Knowing how to code is a very good skill to have in today's society, and I 
                    would love to be able to give back to the community with what I have learned.
