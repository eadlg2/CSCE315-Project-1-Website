                    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

                    <p>
                        Over the years, I have developed many skills that will prove useful in the industry.
                        Throughout my time at Texas A&M, I have been exposed to many different languages. These
                        range from the pure functional language of Haskell to a more high level language like C++.
                        With there being so many programming languages to choose from, it is important to be able 
                        to pick one up relatively quickly. Through exposure to many different languages, I have 
                        been able to learn how to adapt from one to another efficiently. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition to programming skills, I have developed many organizational skills as well. 
                        I always try to stay on top of my work in anything I do. I would rather finish my work early
                        and have time to look over it, than wait until the very last minute. In light of this, I have
                        been able to develop good time management skills that will easily transfer to the workplace. I
                        also work well in a team setting. In a group project, I can be trusted to get my work done
                        in a timely manner and help my team when someone is struggling. Communication plays an important
                        role in a group setting, and through my years of schooling, I have built strong communication
                        skills. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Lastly, I have strong analytical skills. All throughout my life, I have been able to develop unique
                        ideas to solve problems. In addition, I pay strong attention to detail in my work. After all, the
                        smallest things can make the biggest difference. Without careful attention to detail, a project can
                        feel unfinished or unpolished. Projects also should be built on good research. In my courses,
                        I have completed many research projects and been able to develop strong arguments with strong evidence.
                        With good research skills, one can analyze many diverse perspectives on a subject and build a good
                        foundation for a project.

                    <h2>Areas of Interest</h2>

                    <p>
                        One of my main areas of interest is game design and development. Ever since I was a kid, I have always
                        been playing video games. They have brought me endless hours of entertainment and have allowed me to build
                        many skills such as teamwork and communication. I think being able to develop video games would be very 
                        enjoyable, and I would love to be able to give others entertainment through video games.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another area of interest for me is artificial intelligence. Every day, our technology is getting smarter
                        and smarter. While this may be scary at times, it is fascinating to see the ways in which we have been able to
                        advance society with artificial intelligence. AI is present in so many systems that improve our quality
                        of life, and I would love to be able to learn more about it.
