        <p>Howdy!</p>
        <p>
            My name is Evan De la Garza. Currently, I am a junior computer science student
            at Texas A&M. In addition to computer science, I am pursuing a minor in Game Design
            & Development. Games have been a huge part of my life, and I am very excited to be
            able to learn about game design.

            On this website, I have outlined my technical portfolio, resume, and
            community service. I hope you find what you are looking for here. Thanks &
            Gig 'em!
