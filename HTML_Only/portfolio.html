                <p>
                    For my CSCE315 course, I have created a personal website. The purpose of this
                    assignment was to help establish a professional presence on the internet for 
                    potential employers. It contains information about me, my projects, and my 
                    qualifications. This website was made using mainly HTML and CSS with a little bit
                    of JavaScript.

                <p>
                    This project is my first foray into game development with the engine Unity. Through
                    working on this game, I have been able to learn the fundamentals of Unity and even game
                    design altogether. This project is unfinished, but I plan to continue updating it in the 
                    future.

                <p>
                    I have not officially started working on this project yet. However, it is something that I
                    have wanted to work on for a while. The roguelike genre of videogames is one of my favorites,
                    and I think it would be very interesting to develop one of my own. There is still much for me
                    to learn in the world of game design, and I look forward to working on this project. I plan on
                    updating it here as I go along.
